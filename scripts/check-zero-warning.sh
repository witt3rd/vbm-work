# The zero-warning gate and its negative self-test (docs/decisions/0001-vbm-work.md). The build sets warningAsError (lakefile.lean); the mechanism is checked three ways, each of which
# has to HAVE RUN, not merely not-succeeded:
#   1. the option is set in lakefile.lean;
#   2. a file with a warning FAILS under -DwarningAsError=true, and its output carries the warning's own diagnostic ("not explicitly referenced"): a tool that was refused, missing or
#      crashed also "fails", with some other output (the defect of the first version of this check: a heavy-tool guard refused `lake`, the check saw a failure and called it clean);
#   3. a clean file PASSES under the same command (the control: the tool really runs here).
# Prints `ran: zero-warning: 3 cases` on success. Run from the repo root: scripts/check-zero-warning.sh.
