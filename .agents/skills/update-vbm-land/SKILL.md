description: >-
  Update the pinned, vendored copy of vbm-land in a repository (land-update), read the "behind" report of the scheduled check, verify a signed release, and understand the manifest. Use when land-check reports drift, or when asked to bump vbm-land.

# update-vbm-land

A repository vendors a pinned copy: `.land/tool/` (tool, templates and `MANIFEST.sha256`, the hash of every vendored file, all of them drift-checked), `.land/PIN` (source, version, 40-hex commit, manifest hash, signature status), the `.land/land-direct` entry script (yours after the first install), the vbm-land skills in `.agents/skills/`. Everything the tool owns is under `.land/`; the repository's own `scripts/` stays its own. Updates are **pulled by the repository**: nothing schedules one (no CI, no workflow, no Tier 2), vbm-land knows nothing about what vendors it.

## Know where you stand

```
.land/tool/bin/land-check              # offline: the copy still equals its pin (0 ok, 1 drift, 2 not installed)
.land/tool/bin/land-check --upstream   # also asks the source about the pinned commit (3: source unreachable)
.land/tool/bin/land-update --check     # read-only: "pinned vX, latest vY: behind N releases (patch|minor|major)" (0 current, 1 behind, 3 unreachable)
```

## Update (the repository's own act)

1. `.land/tool/bin/land-update --diff vX.Y.Z`: verifies the release (below) and shows the changed, added and removed vendored files, their diffs and the CHANGELOG entries since your pin. Read it: new keys, exit codes, "Upgrade notes". A **major** release needs a person's decision.
2. `.land/tool/bin/land-update --land vX.Y.Z` from a clean worktree: verify, stage, commit `chore(land): vbm-land vX.Y.Z` (with the trailers your `land.conf` requires) and land it through **your own** lander and gates, run from a pristine clone of the base branch. A hold, a red main, a failed Tier 1, a refusing hook or the attack suite stops it with the lander's exit code; the commit stays local; nothing is forced.
   Or by hand: `.land/tool/bin/land-update vX.Y.Z` (stages only), `.land/tool/bin/land-check`, review `git status`, one commit, `.land/land-direct`.
3. A release that RETIRES paths (files that moved into the tool: `.land/tool/lib/retired-paths.txt`) makes `land-check` fail until the repository's own copies are gone. In the SAME commit as the update: delete each retired path that exists, point its callers at the vendored one (for example `. scripts/lib-ran.sh` becomes `. .land/tool/lib/ran.sh`), and delete the tests of the copies; the tool tests them. Nothing else changes in that commit.



## Signed releases

A release is an annotated tag signed by the maintainer's ssh key, recording the hash of `MANIFEST.sha256`. List the public keys you trust in `.land/land.signers` (an ssh allowed-signers file from the source, taken out of band: `install --signers FILE` on the first install). With that file, `land-update` and `install` **refuse** anything that is not such a tag (a commit, a lightweight or unsigned tag, an unknown signer, a manifest hash that differs) **before** anything of the release runs or is written. Without it they say `UNVERIFIED` and the PIN records `signature=unverified`: add the file. A change to `.land/land.signers` is a key change: it is reviewed like one.

## Drift

`DRIFT:` lines name the file. Fix by **restoring**, not editing: `.land/tool/bin/land-update <pinned version>` (the version is in `.land/PIN`). A local need becomes a config key or a hook in your own `.land/land.d/`, or a change upstream.

## Do NOT

- Do not edit `.land/tool/`, `MANIFEST.sha256`, `PIN` or the vendored skills by hand, and never "fix" drift by regenerating the manifest in a consumer.
- Do not update to an untagged commit unless asked, and do not skip verification (never remove `.land/land.signers` to make an update pass).
- Do not mix the update with other changes in one commit.
- Do not take a major release without the owner's decision.
